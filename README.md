# syntax-and-semantic-videos
For the syntax and semantics course at the university, we've to watch 100+ youtube videos. The sound on many of these are quite low. Surely a CS boi can gather these links, and play them at 800% volume in VLC.

I still have yet to implement the VLC part.

# Usage
```npm install``` followed by ```npm run electron-build-and-run```.

# Disclaimer
The videos are all made by [Hans HÃ¼ttel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCiXT1k2RN37TrjekAqb09Q) and are shared under the "CC BY-NC 4.0" license. This program will just show the videos in a nicer way, and easily allow you to open the videos in VLC, where you have the possibility to play them at a higher volume. In the program a link will be shown to the videos and credit will once again be given.
