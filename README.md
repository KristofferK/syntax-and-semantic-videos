# syntax-and-semantic-videos
For the syntax and semantics course at the university, we've to watch 100+ youtube videos. The sound on many of these are quite low. Surely a CS boi can gather these links, and play them at 800% volume in VLC.

The program is made in Electron, but will be Windows only for now.

# Disclaimer
The videos are all made by Hans Hüttel and are shared under the "CC BY-NC 4.0" license. This program will just show the videos in a nicer way, and easily allow you to open the videos in VLC, where you have the possibility to play them at a higher volume.
